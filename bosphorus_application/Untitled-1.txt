After generic algorithm: I conclude that a set of probes P is optimal when [35..50]

Given that cost([0..40], 1) = 0

is P also optimal in [0..50]?

cost([0..39], 2) = 0, cost(0..40, 2) = cost(0..41, 1)








-------------------------------------------------


probes: [50..60], [55..65]

accuracy distribution: [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]

[50..60]:
    [50..51] -> there is a chance of 0.2 of detecting the submarine if the submarine is in [50..51]
    [51..52] -> there is a chance of 0.4 of detecting the submarine if the submarine is in [51..52]
    [52..53] -> there is a chance of 0.6 of detecting the submarine if the submarine is in [52..53]
    [53..54] -> there is a chance of 0.8 of detecting the submarine if the submarine is in [53..54]
    ...

same with [55..65]

É que estou num gabinete de voluntariado, e a minha organização precisa de saber se podemos continuar a contar com o Técnico.
